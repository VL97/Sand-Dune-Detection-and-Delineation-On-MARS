The 'keras ANN.py' file implements an Artificial Neural Network(ANN)
and trains the network for texture differentiation through input features 
obtained by LBP histogram and classifies them into 1(sand) or 0(terrain).
It then tests the ANN on 16 images from 'test' folder and prints the overall
test prediction accuracy. The source and type of images for training are
same as used in 'ML classifier approach' Folder.
