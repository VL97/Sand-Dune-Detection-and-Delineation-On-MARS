PASTE THE 'LBP.PNG' AND 'FINAL_MASK.PNG' OBTAINED FROM THE 'MASK MAKER' FOLDER.

STEP 1:
RUN 'input splitter.py'. IT WILL CREATE SLICES OF 'LBP.PNG' IMAGE. THESE SLICES ARE FURTHER FLIPPED HORIZONTALLY AND VERTICALLY, ROTATED BY 90 DEGREES. HENCE FOR EVERY 1 SLICE TRAVERSED IN THE 'LBP.PNG' 4 IMAGES ARE SAVED IN THE 'LBP INPUTS FOR TRAINING' FOLDER. IF THESE FOLDERS ARE NOT PRESENT(EMPTY DIRECTORIES ARE REMOVED BY GIT), PLEASE CREATE THOSE. 

STEP 2:
RUN 'mask splitter.py'. IT WILL CREATE SLICES OF 'FINAL_MASK.PNG' IMAGE. THESE SLICES ARE FURTHER FLIPPED HORIZONTALLY AND VERTICALLY, ROTATED BY 90 DEGREES. HENCE FOR EVERY 1 SLICE TRAVERSED IN THE 'FINAL_MASK.PNG' 4 IMAGES ARE SAVED IN THE 'MASKS FOR TRAINING' FOLDER. 


WARNING:DO NOT RENAME ANY IMAGE PRODUCED BY ABOVE STEPS AS THE U-NET PICKS INPUT IMAGE AND CORRESPONDING MASK IMAGE OF SAME NAME FROM DIFFERENT DIRECTORIES AND RENAMING CAN CAUSE FAILURE TO FIND CORRESPONDING IMAGE FILE BY IT DURING TRAINING.THE ALGORITHM FOLLOWS THE SAME SCHEME IN BOTH RUNS, JUST THE INPUT IMAGE AND OUTPUT FOLDER IS CHANGED HENCE IT CREATES SAME NAMED LBP AND CORRESPONDING MASK IMAGES IN THE 'LBP INPUTS FOR TRAINING' AND 'MASKS FOR TRAINING' FOLDERS.

NOTE:
YOU CAN CHANGE THE 'PASS_DENSITY' PARAMETER (BUT KEEP IT SAME IN BOTH CODES) TO TRAVERSE THE IMAGE MORE DENSELY CREATING MORE IMAGE SLICES DUE TO SMALL MOVEMENT OF THE SLICING WINDOW IN BOTH X AND Y DIRECTIONS. BOTH CODE ARE SET TO TAKE SLICES MEASURING 976X976 PIXELS. YOU CAN INCREASE THE DATASET FURTHERMORE BY ADDING MORE IMAGE AUGMENTATION TECHNIQUES TO THE CODE LIKE ROTATING BY ARBITRARY ANGLE, ZOOMING IN AND OUT ETC.


$THE ORIGINAL 'STOSS-ONLY-MODEL' DATASET FOR OUR REPORT IS ALREADY COPIED TO RELEVANT DIRECTORIES IN 'TRAIN-UNET' FOLDER HENCE YOU MAY NOT FOLLOW THE STEPS BELOW AND PROCEED TO 'TRAIN-UNET' FOLDER DIRECTLY AND SEE 'README' THERE.

STEP 3:
TAKE 80% IMAGES FROM THE 'LBP INPUTS FOR TRAINING' AND PUT THEM IN 'TRAIN U-NET/train/inputs'.

STEP 4:
TAKE 80% IMAGES  FROM THE 'MASKS FOR TRAINING' FOLDER (SHOULD BE SAME CORRESPONDING NAMES AS TAKEN IN ABOVE STEP) AND PUT THEM IN 'TRAIN U-NET/train/masks'.

STEP 5:
TAKE 20% IMAGES FROM THE 'LBP INPUTS FOR TRAINING' AND PUT THEM IN 'TRAIN U-NET/valid/inputs'.

STEP 6:
TAKE 20% IMAGES  FROM THE 'MASKS FOR TRAINING' FOLDER (SHOULD BE SAME CORRESPONDING NAMES AS TAKEN IN ABOVE STEP) AND PUT THEM IN 'TRAIN U-NET/valid/masks'.

STEP 7:
PROCEED TO 'TRAIN-UNET' FOLDER AND SEE 'README' THERE.
