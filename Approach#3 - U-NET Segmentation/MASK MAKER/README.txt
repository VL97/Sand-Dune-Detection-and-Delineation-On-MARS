************STEPS TO CREAT INPUTS AND MASKS FOR TRAINING************

WE NEED TO HAVE (LBP IMAGES AS INPUTS) AND CORRESPONDING (MASKS AS LABELS) TO BE FED TO THE U-NET.
WE FIRST CREATE (WHOLE LBP IMAGE) AND (WHOLE MASK IMAGE) FROM THE RAW IMAGE 'INPUT.PNG'.

---------------------
MASK MAKING

STEP1:
DRAW BOUNDARY ON THE ORIGINAL RAW IMAGE FROM WHICH TRAINING HAS TO BE DONE
EXAMPLE: RAW INPUT IMAGE 'INPUT.PNG' IS DRAWN BY REDDISH LIKE COLOR(RGB VALUE=237,28,36) BY HAND IN MS-PAINT AND SAVED AS 'DRAWN.PNG'

STEP2:
RUN 'MASK MAKER.PY'
IT TAKES INPUT IMAGE AS 'DRAWN.PNG'. WHEREVER IT FINDS FOREMENTIONED REDDISH COLOR, IT REPLACES THE PIXEL WITH WHITE(255,255,255) ELSE IT REPLACES THE PIXEL WITH BLACK(0,0,0). ITS SAVES THE OUTPUT AS 'MASK_BOUNDARY.PNG'.

STEP3:
OPEN PAINT AND FILL COLOR IN THE STOSS SIDE TO GET IMAGE LIKE 'FINAL_MASK.PNG'. THUS WE GET THE FINAL MASK.
'FINAL_MASK.PNG' IS THE REQUIRED MASK WHICH NEEDS TO BE DATA AUGMENTED AND SPLITTED TO SMALLER SLICES.

-----------------------
INPUT MAKING

STEP1:
RUN 'TOLBP.PY'. IT TAKES SAME INPUT IMAGE 'INPUT.IMG' AND RETURNS THE LBP PROCESSED IMAGE AS 'LBP.PNG'.
'LBP.PNG' IS THE REQUIRED INPUT WHICH NEEDS TO BE DATA AUGMENTED AND SPLITTED TO SMALLER SLICES.
------------------------

FINAL STEP:
TAKE 'LBP.PNG' AND AND 'FINAL_MASK.PNG' TO THE 'SPLITTER' FOLDER WHICH IS ONE DIRECTORY UP AND SEE 'README' THERE.
