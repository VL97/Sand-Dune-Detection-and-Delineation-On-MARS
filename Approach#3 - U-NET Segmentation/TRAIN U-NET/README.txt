**************THIS CODE IMPLEMENTS KERAS U-NET**************

'UNET.py' CODE TRAINS THE MODEL ON 'INPUTS' AND 'MASKS' FROM 'TRAIN' FOLDER AND 
VALIDATES IT ON DIFFERENT 'INPUTS' AND 'MASKS' ON THE 'VALID' FOLDER. USUALLY TAKE 20-25% OF THE DATASET FOR VALIDATION. 
THE CODE RUNS FOR TOTAL 5 EPOCHS. THE FINAL MODEL IS SAVED AFTER THE LAST EPOCH IN A .h5 FILE. 

STEP 1 : JUST RUN THE CODE IMPORTANT: CHECK BEFORE RUNNING:
ALL INPUT IMAGES IN 'train/inputs' FOLDER HAVE THERE CORRESPONDING SAME NAMED MASK IMAGES IN THE 'train/masks'FOLDER.
ALL INPUT IMAGES IN 'valid/inputs' FOLDER HAVE THERE CORRESPONDING SAME NAMED MASK IMAGES IN THE 'valid/masks'FOLDER.

STEP 2 :WHEN TRAINING IS FINISHED, TAKE THE .h5 file to 'TEST U-NET' FOLDER and follow 'README' there.
