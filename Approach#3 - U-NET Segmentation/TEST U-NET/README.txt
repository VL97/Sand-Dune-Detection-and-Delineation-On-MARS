*************
'test.py' CODE TAKES AN INPUT IMAGE 'input.png' FOR TESTING THE MODEL, IT INTERNALLY CONVERTS IT INTO LOCAL BINARY PATTERN(LBP) AND PASSES IT TO THE TRAINED MODEL GIVEN BY THE  
.h5 FILE. THE EXAMPLE MODEL 'example_Stoss_model' WAS OUR ORIGINAL MODEL FOR OUR REPORT TRAINED FOR 5 EPOCHS TO RECOGNISE ONLY STOSS SIDE WITH LBP PARAMETERS FOR TRAINING DATA AS P=1 AND
R=20. HENCE IF USING THIS MODEL, USE THESE LBP PARAMETERS ONLY IN THE 'test.py' CODE. THE OUTPUT IS SAVED IN 'ouput.png' AND THE CORRESPONDING SOBEL EDGE FILE IN
'output_edge.png' IN SAME DIRECTORY.
*************

STEPS: JUST RUN THE CODE. IF YOU HAVE YOUR OWN .h5 FILE FROM THE 'TRAIN U-NET' FOLDER PASTE IT HERE AND UPDATE THE .h5 FILE NAME IN THE CODE. IF YOU HAVE TRAINED YOUR MODEL USING DIFFERENT LBP PARAMETERS, TESTING MUST BE DONE WITH THE SAME PARAMETERS, HENCE CHANGE THE PARAMETERS IN THE 'test.py' TOO.
